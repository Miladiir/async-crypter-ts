## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

In the unfortunate case of a vulnerability, please head over to [Github Issues](https://github.com/Miladiir/node-async-crypter-ts/issues) and file an issue there.
I will not notify you of updates until the issue fixed, in which case a new update will be pushed out.
If you want status updates, please request them in the issue that you filed.
Please understand that it is sometimes not possible to respond immediately.
